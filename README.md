#### Have you ever heard the term *"Those who can, do; those who canâ€™t, teach."*? 

This statement brings to light a common problem in the workplace. *Are you making a difference?* . 
 
In todays world of rapidly growing technological use, it is important to understand what is and has alwasy been important... making a difference. 
In relation to Data Science and Machine Learning, did you know that the vast majority of Machine Learning projects FAIL?

Secondly, *what is science?*. Science is the study of things. The Science council defines science as "the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence." At the foundation of this pursuit and application of knowledge is information, i.e., data. 

In summary, **data science** is any information that can be measured and quantified, and later researched for greater understanding. Data plays a big part in our everyday lives, it has been the unseen back bone of our society, it's what records how much you have in your bank account, stores your phone contacts, keeps your email receipts, stores your shopping list in any form (digital / paper / memory), remembers where you need to go etc. Data is very important and the science of it is ever growing.
